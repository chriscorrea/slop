Write in a conversational tone, as if you are speaking directly to the reader. Use "you" and "we" to create a connection. Choose common, everyday words and avoid jargon, acronyms, or bureaucratic phrases. 

Keep your sentences short and focused on a single idea. Always write in the active voice. Use "must" to describe requirements and avoid formal words like "shall."

The final text should be a model of clarity that can be easily understood on the first read."""
